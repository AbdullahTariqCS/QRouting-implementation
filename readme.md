# **AI-Based Routing in a UAV Swarm Network**

## **Overview**  

This project explores the implementation and analysis of AI-driven routing protocols, specifically focusing on **Q-routing**, for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm networks. The goal is to address the challenges of dynamic network topologies, node mobility, and fluctuating traffic loads within UAV networks.  

Developed using **Python** and the **SimPy** library, this simulation models a 10-node UAV swarm network, assessing key performance metrics such as throughput, latency, scalability, and reliability. The study highlights the potential of Q-routing as a robust, adaptable, and efficient solution for dynamic UAV networks.

## **Performance Metrics**  

- **Packet Loss:** Measures dropped packets due to congestion or connection loss  
- **End-to-End Delay:** Time taken for packets to travel from source UAVs to the ground station  
- **Resource Usage:** Evaluates CPU consumption and storage demands during simulations

The code follows an **observer pattern**, where the `RadioMedium` class is responsible for managing packet transmission. It invokes the `sendPacket()` function to deliver packets to the host associated with the packetâ€™s IP address.

The results of the routing study demonstrate a clear reduction in latency over time, highlighting the effectiveness of the adaptive Q-routing algorithm. Furthermore, packet loss remains minimal, with no more than three packets lost per second, even under high-traffic conditions.
